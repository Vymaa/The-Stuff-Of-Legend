This modpack aims to design a carefully balanced gameplay that remains consistent with the base game, while enhancing its mechanics. With its carefully configured mods, you can dive straight into the action without needing a guidebook to learn again how to play Minecraft. Everything is meant to be intuitive, following the functionalities already in place.

  - Experience great adventures without feeling completely out of place. Cross over new lands that retain the familiar feeling you're used to. Overcome revamped dungeons as well as exciting new ones.

  - Face more dangerous enemies with increasing difficulty as you progress. Bosses and achievements have also been implemented to provide a wider range of goals to accomplish.

  - Become more powerful by applying a wider variety of enchantments to your equipment. Use amulets, tablets, new weapons and more to gain specific advantages. Master a rethinked combat system inspired by the snapshots to crush your enemies even more effectively.

  - You can easily bring your friends along without frustration, thanks to convenient multiplayer features. Your fellow pets have also been redesigned to reduce the risk of losing them, as well as to make them more helpful.

  - Experience a smoother, more enjoyable gameplay than before, thanks to a bunch of quality-of-life features.

  - Benefit from a wider variety of visual effects and ambient sounds, immersing you in a livelier atmosphere.

If a more immersive atmosphere is what you're after, you can enable the Complementary Reimagined shader, which is deeply customized to shape a visual experience based on the trailers and Vibrant Visuals.
